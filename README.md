# Clucky

Clucky is an HTTP -> StatsD proxy to facilitate RUM. It is inspired by
[Bucky](http://github.hubspot.com/BuckyServer/), but offers a few additional
advantages:

* Whitelisting of keys to mitigate DOS/DDOS attacks on your Graphite server;
* Serves requests on multiple threads for higher performance;
